# Messaging System Error Analysis

## Critical Issues Identified:

### 1. RLS Policy Authentication Mismatch
**Problem**: The RLS policies are using `split_part(auth.email(), '@', 1)` but the authentication system stores the full wallet address in the JWT token's 'sub' field.
**Impact**: Messages cannot be inserted into the database due to policy violations.
**Fix**: Update RLS policies to use the correct authentication method.

### 2. Profile Creation Issues
**Problem**: The system tries to query profiles with `.single()` which throws an error when no profile exists.
**Impact**: Authentication fails when profiles don't exist.
**Fix**: Use `.maybeSingle()` and handle profile creation properly.

### 3. Gun.js Connectivity Issues
**Problem**: Gun.js peers may be unreliable, causing "offline" status even when online.
**Impact**: Users appear offline and messages aren't delivered in real-time.
**Fix**: Improve Gun.js peer configuration and add fallback mechanisms.

### 4. Shared Key Generation Failures
**Problem**: When users are offline, shared key generation fails completely.
**Impact**: Messages cannot be encrypted and sent.
**Fix**: Implement message queuing and retry mechanisms.

### 5. Message Status Tracking
**Problem**: No proper status tracking for message delivery states.
**Impact**: Users don't know if messages were sent, delivered, or failed.
**Fix**: Implement comprehensive status tracking system.

### 6. Presence Detection Issues
**Problem**: Online/offline status detection is unreliable.
**Impact**: Users appear offline when they're actually online.
**Fix**: Improve presence detection with heartbeat mechanism.

### 7. Message Queuing Missing
**Problem**: No mechanism to queue messages when recipients are offline.
**Impact**: Messages are lost if recipient is not online.
**Fix**: Implement persistent message queuing.

## Solutions Implemented:

1. Fixed RLS policies to use correct JWT field
2. Added proper profile creation handling
3. Improved Gun.js configuration with better peers
4. Added message queuing and retry mechanisms
5. Enhanced status tracking with visual indicators
6. Improved presence detection system
7. Added offline message delivery
